# SERENITY
The aim of "SERENITY" is to show the importance of meditation and it's effects on overall wellbeing and health.
<br>

The site is aimed people interested in learning about mind/body and self-improvement techniques. The site will include sections with links to articles that explain the importance of meditating, how to meditate and different forms of meditation. 

You will also find on the website a page filled with pictures of different forms of meditation to remind users that meditation is not a one-size fits all. You can meditate through hiking, reading, spending time indoors/outdoors, relaxing on so on. The combination of picures aims to create a feeling of warmeness and inspiration for all users.

<br>

The site has a clean, simple design with a light cool colour pallete and interesting pictures to inspire users!

## FEATURES

Existing Features
### Navigation bar
* The navigation bar is the same on each page as you navigate across each link. The nav bar consists of a 'Home', 'Meditation' and 'Contact' page. Each link will take you to the designated page and clicking the logo area is a simple and easy way back to the home page. 
* For ease, I opted out of creating a 'burger' menu section and decided to keep the nav bar the same regardless of the link clicked, this allows users to see the window options at all times.
